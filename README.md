# Project Title

Robot Control Simulator.

## Description

Create a Javascript application in which you can simulate controlling a robot. The robot should be placed on a 5x5 grid. Supply controls that let you move the robot forwards in the direction it is facing, and rotate the robot in place to face any cardinal direction. Use any Javascript framework you’re comfortable with, as long as it runs in modern web browsers (we’re not looking for backwards compatibility in this test). Take a look around bellroy.com and use what you see to give your application a Bellroy “look”.

## Getting Started

Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. Grid Setup: The robot will be placed on a 5x5 grid.
2. Robot State: We'll manage the robot’s position and direction (north, south, east, west).
3. Controls: Add buttons for rotating the robot and moving it forward.
4. Bellroy Design: We'll keep the design minimalist and use soft colors with rounded buttons, similar to Bellroy's aesthetic.
